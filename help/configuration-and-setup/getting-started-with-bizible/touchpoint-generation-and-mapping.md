# Touchpoint Generation and Mapping {#touchpoint-generation-and-mapping}

Bizible’s attribution stories hinge on two processes:

* Touchpoint generation, which creates touchpoints that represent a person’s interactions with your marketing and sales efforts
* Touchpoint mapping, which credits touchpoints to the appropriate channel and subchannel

In order for you to get the most out of Bizible, you should work with your Bizible rep to customize both processes to suit your organization’s needs.

Touchpoint Generation Methods  
  
The touchpoint generation process answers the question, “How is Bizible going to know that this occurred?” Depending on your feature set and the types of interactions your prospective customers can have, there are up to three ways Bizible can pick up on an interaction and create a touchpoint to represent it.

| **Type of Interaction** |**Example** |**Touchpoint Generation Method** |
|---|---|---|
| Online, on your site(s) |Form fill |Bizible JavaScript |
| Offline; Online not on your site(s) |Tradeshows; Content syndication partner delivers a list of Lead who engaged with your content |CRM Campaign membership synced to Bizible, either by setting the Campaign Sync Type directly in the campaign or by setting rules on the Campaigns page in Bizible |
| Sales activity |Outbound call by SDR |CRM Activity (Task or Event) record synced to Bizible, through logic on the Activities page in Bizible |

Touchpoint Mapping Methods  
  
The touchpoint mapping process answers the question, “Once this touchpoint’s been created, how is Bizible going to know what channel and subchannel it belongs to?” Each method of touchpoint generation has its own method of touchpoint mapping.

| **Type of Interaction** |**Generation Method ** |**Mapping Method** |
|---|---|---|
| Online, on your site(s) |Bizible JavaScript |Through the Online Channels page in Bizible, by referencing UTM values, landing page, and referring page information |
| Offline; Online, not on your site(s) |CRM Campaign membership sync |Through the Offline Channels page in Bizible, by referencing Campaign Type |
| Sales activity |CRM Activity sync |Through the Online Channels page in Bizible, by referencing the Campaign Name assigned on the Activities page |
